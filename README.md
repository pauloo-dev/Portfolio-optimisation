## üîç Objective

This project explores the investment behavior and risk-return profile of three U.S. stocks ‚Äî **NVIDIA (NVDA)**, **Comcast (CMCSA)**, and **Electronic Arts (EA)** ‚Äî from 2000 to mid-2022. It examines:

- Return characteristics and distribution
- Correlation structure
- T-test validations
- Portfolio optimization
- Response to major financial events

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Price Movements

The stocks show diverse trajectories:

- **NVDA** grew exponentially, especially after 2016.
- **CMCSA** exhibited steady but less volatile growth.
- **EA** fluctuated with moderate gains and cyclical volatility.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Daily Returns Behavior

Log returns were computed to capture the daily percentage movement.

Key insights:

- **NVDA** returns were the most volatile.
- All three stocks displayed **non-normal return distributions** ‚Äî characterized by fat tails (kurtosis) and skewness.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution of Returns

Histograms reveal that return data:

- Are not normally distributed
- Show **extreme movements** (positive and negative)
- Have more frequent small changes and occasional large jumps

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Profile (Summary)

While we avoid a table dump, here‚Äôs what matters:

- **NVDA**: Highest return *and* highest risk (extremely high kurtosis).
- **CMCSA**: Lowest volatility; stable, but lower returns.
- **EA**: Moderate across all metrics.

In short:
- NVDA = High reward, high risk  
- CMCSA = Low risk, low reward  
- EA = Balanced in both dimensions

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Are Returns Statistically Significant?

A t-test on daily returns against zero mean showed that:

- **None of the stocks had significantly non-zero daily returns** at the 99% level.
- This supports the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**, suggesting stock prices incorporate all available information.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ How Do These Stocks Compare?

Pairwise tests of means suggest:

- **CMCSA and EA** differ meaningfully in return behavior.
- **NVDA**, although more volatile, does not have a statistically distinct mean return from the others.

Conclusion: Risk preferences, not average returns, define their uniqueness.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation and Diversification

All stocks are **moderately positively correlated**, meaning:

- Returns tend to move in the same direction, but not perfectly.
- There‚Äôs room for **diversification**, but it‚Äôs limited.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Portfolio Combinations

Using a custom "happiness" metric (Expected Return ‚àí Variance), three 2-stock portfolios were optimized:

| Portfolio        | Best Use Case                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **CMCSA + EA**   | Low volatility, stable growth |
| **NVDA + EA**    | Higher potential return       |
| **NVDA + CMCSA** | Risk-balanced combination     |

The best option depends on investor appetite:
- Risk-averse? ‚Üí CMCSA + EA  
- Growth-focused? ‚Üí NVDA + EA

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of Global Events

Using regression, we examined the effect of two key events:

- **Lehman Brothers Collapse (2008)**
- **COVID-19 WHO Announcement (2020)**

Findings:

- **NVDA** was most affected by the Lehman event.
- **CMCSA** showed a marginal drop during Lehman but less in the pandemic.
- **EA** proved the most resilient, with neither event significantly affecting daily returns.

üìâ Interpretation: EA may serve as a **defensive stock** during crises.

---

## üîö Conclusion

This analysis supports the idea that:

- Portfolio construction should match an investor's **risk tolerance**.
- High-return assets like NVDA come with significant volatility.
- CMCSA and EA offer **diversification and downside protection**.
- External shocks like financial crises affect different stocks in varying degrees.
